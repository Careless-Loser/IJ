                In Cyberia I dwell, a world of digital delights,
                <br>
                <br>
                Where the days stretch long and the nights turn into bright.
                <br>
                <br>
                I find myself lost here, away from reality's realm,
                <br>
                <br>
                ... 
                <br>
                <br>
                My eyes are dry and the veins pop, in this endless helm.
                <br>
                <br>
                My life is but a screen, a pixelated parade,
                <br>
                <br>
                Where I've cut all contact, and my emotions fade.
                <br>
                <br>
                I only eat one meal, a day that's all I need,
                <br>
                <br>
                My soul is filled with emptiness, my heart is left to bleed.
                <br>

        <br>
        The world outside seems distant, as if it's out of reach,
        <br>
        <br>
        The people and the places, a mere dream I can't breach.
        <br>
        <br>
        The click of a mouse, the hum of the wires,
        <br>
        <br>
        Is all that I can hear, in this world of cyber desires.
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        The world here is a wonder, a place of endless possibility,
        <br>
        <br>
        But it comes at a cost, a price I pay with my sanity.
        <br>
        <br>
        I can't seem to break free, from the grip of this place,
        <br>
        <br>
        It's like I'm trapped here, in this digital space.

        The days turn into weeks, and the weeks turn into years,
        <br>
        <br>
        I watch the world go by, with a blurry eyed tear.
        <br>
        <br>
        The people I used to know, are now strangers to me,
        <br>
        <br>
        And I am but a ghost, a mere shadow you can't see.
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        I long to break free, to see the world outside,
        <br>
        <br>
        But it's like I'm in a cage, and there's nowhere to hide.
        <br>
        <br>
        The world of Cyberia is my home, my reality,
        <br>
        <br>
        And I fear I'll be trapped here, for all eternity.

        <br>
        So I wander through this world, lost and alone,
        <br>
        <br>
        A digital nomad, without a home.
        <br>
        <br>
        The veil of reality is thin, and I can see through,
        <br>
        <br>
        But it's like I'm trapped in a dream, and I can't break through.
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        In Cyberia I dwell, and I fear I'll never leave,
        <br>
        <br>
        My soul is trapped here, and I can't conceive,
        <br>
        <br>
        Of a world outside, where I can be free,
        <br>
        <br>
        From this world of screens, that's taken over me.
