                Life is short, time is flimsy, and the days 
                <br>
                <br>
                are caught in a whirlwind of moments 
                <br>
                <br>
                passing by, so grime if you must.
                <br>
                <br>
                like meteors streaking across the sky.

                ...
        <br>
        <br>
        Don't forget to embrace the joys of 
        <br>
        <br>
        creation, both large and small, which give 
        <br>
        <br>
        us all meaning and purpose as 
        <br>
        <br>
        you organize and clean your space.

        Instead of simply wiping the dirt and grime,
        <br>
        <br>
        Grab a brush, let your creativity soar, and
        <br>
        <br>
        Create a picture, let the colors flow, and 
        <br>
        <br>
        capture the entire world in one sight.
        <br>
        <br>
        ...
        <br>
        <br>
        or use a pen and paper to write.
        <br>
        <br>
        To a friend or foe, write a letter.
        <br>
        <br>
        Share your ideas, aspirations, and dreams,
        <br>
        <br>
        Let the light of your words shine like the sun.

        Watch a pollen grow by cultivating it,

        Observe the miracle of life's lovely display,

        Think about the distinction between want and need.
        <br>
      <br>
        Consider what truly fills your heart—not 
        <br>
      <br>
        it's material things or illusory fame, but 
        <br>
      <br>
        treasured moments and a caring flame.
        <br>
        <br>

        There are rivers to swim in and mountains to

        climb, and there are adventures in every climate.
        <br>
      <br>
        Reading books that complete us and

        listening to music that uplifts the spirit.
