        A small flower tries not be be seen
        <br>
        <br>
        But someone spots her and flies past the bees
        <br>
        <br>
        A little ghost, so small and sweet
        <br>
        <br>
        But the flower still didn't make a peep
        <br>
        <br>
        "Flowers are pretty" the ghost said to nobody
        <br>
        <br>
        "Especially roses" the flower felt like floating
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        The flower spoke up for the first time
        <br>
        <br>
        "I'm a rose, isn't that nice?"
        <br>
        <br>
        The ghost and the rose would talk for hours
        <br>
        <br>
        The nervousness escaping the flower
        <br>
        <br>
        The ghost swore to never leave her side
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        That midnight in June felt so divine
        <br>
        <br>
        When the sun went up, the ghost didn't hide
        <br>
        <br>
        She ducked down, but swore to stay nearby
        <br>
        <br>
        The flower had never had a friend
        <br>
        <br>
        This was a lot for her to take in
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        The ghost would stop ducking once the sun said goodbye
        <br>
        <br>
        And then they'd talk, their voices like chimes
        <br>
        <br>
        When the rose wilted, her soul would appear
        <br>
        <br>
        And the first thing she did was to hug the ghost, still near
        <br>
        <br>
        They now were closer than you could presume
        <br>
        <br>
        and it's all because of a midnight in June

        Somedays I stand against the wall
        <br>
        <br>
        and pretend I don't exist
        <br>
        <br>
        Other days I feel my friends
        <br>
        <br>
        do the same I often feel ignored
        <br>
        <br>
        no matter how loud I become
        <br>
        <br>
        I will always remain silent
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        I may as well be a ghost
        <br>
        <br>
        I often don't exist
        <br>
        <br>
        I scare others to whom
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm unknown
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm missed by those who do
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        One day I'll die
        <br>
        <br>
        I'll be forgotten
        <br>
        <br>
        soon I'll become a real ghost
        <br>
        <br>
        and maybe I'll become a immortal
        <br>
        <br>
        never to be forgotten
        <br>
        <br>
        but I guess I'll never know
        <br>
        <br>
        because I'm alive right now
        <br>
        <br>
        and not yet them

        I am so overwhelmed by life.
        <br>
        <br>
        Floored by my own emotions.
        <br>
        <br>
        My god, there are days when I forget
        <br>
        <br>
        what happiness means let alone how it feels.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's all quite dramatic.
        <br>
        <br>
        Perhaps I am a little melodramatic.
        <br>
        <br>
        I live life like a theatre production.
        <br>
        <br>
        Except I forgot all my lines and the lights are too bright.
        <br>
        <br>
        There won't be a saviour but I refuse to draw the curtains.
        <br>
        <br>
        I improvise and make it up as I go along.
        <br>
        <br>
        Take comfort in the unknown. yes, I'm terrified.
        <br>
        <br>
        Brush off the absurdity with a laugh.
        <br>
        <br>
        Everything is funny once you let go.
