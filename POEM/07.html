        She didn't require much and desired very little.

        A kind word, sincerity, fresh air, clean water,

        a garden, caresses, books to read, a warm bed, 
        <br>

        "Despite all this, writing really is a good thing; 
        <br>
        <br>
        I am now calmer than I was 2 hours ago outside on the balcony with your letter. 
        <br>
        <br>
        While I was lying there a beetle had fallen on its back one step away and was desperately trying to right itself; 
        <br>
        <br>
        I would have gladly helped—it was so easy, so obvious, 
        <br>
        <br>
        all that was required was a step and a small shove—but I forgot about it because of your letter; 
        <br>
        <br>
        I was just as incapable of getting up. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Only a lizard again made me aware of the life around me, 
        <br>
        <br>
        its path led over the beetle, 
        <br>
        <br>
        which was already so completely still that I said to myself, 
        <br>
        <br>
        this was not an accident but death throes, 
        <br>
        <br>
        the rarely witnessed drama of an animal's natural death; 
        <br>
        <br>
        but when the lizard slid off the beetle, 
        <br>
        <br>
        the beetle was righted although it did lie there a little longer as if dead, 
        <br>
        <br>
        but then ran up the wall of the house as if nothing had happened. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Some how this probably gave me, too, a little courage; 
        <br>
        <br>
        I got up, drank some milk and wrote to you."

        The traffic stopped sounding like a siren's call.
        <br>
        <br>
        I clenched my eyes & a white light appeared, grew, & I flew through it.
        <br>
        <br>
        I can't remember what day it is.
        <br>
        <br>
        Everything feels like a hazy dream.
        <br>
        <br> 
        Time is flowing like a river around and over me.
        <br>
        <br>
        I can't remember a day when it wasn't like this.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can.
