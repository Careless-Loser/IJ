        more like fake it till you have

        no grasp of which parts of you are real

        <br>

        <br>

        Let me tell you something.
        <br>
        <br>
        Just because it happened in
        <br>
        <br>
        a dream doesn't make it not real.
        <br>
        <br>
        Dreams are real life too.

        <br>
        In my dreams, 
        <br>
        <br>
        the thing that 
        <br>
        <br>
        looks like you is kinder...

        <br>
        ... 
        <br>

        It's either I do suffer from
        <br>
        <br>
        Black and White thinking or
        <br>
        <br>
        I don't and I definetely do,
        <br>
        <br>
        there's no doubt about it.
