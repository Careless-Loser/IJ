                In the shadows, a man with cap,
                <br>
                <br>
                A figure cloaked in darkness, a sinister trap,
                <br>
                <br>
                His presence loomed, bringing fear,
                <br>
                <br>
                An evil force that drew trauma near.
                <br>
                <br>
                ... 
                <br>
                <br>
                His eyes held malice, devoid of light,
                <br>
                <br>
                A predator lurking, ready to strike,
                <br>
                <br>
                With twisted pleasure, he inflicted pain,
                <br>
                <br>
                Leaving scars that forever remain.

        <br>
        His touch, a venomous sting,
        <br>
        <br>
        An encounter that shattered everything,
        <br>
        <br>
        Innocence stolen, trust torn apart,
        <br>
        <br>
        His wicked deeds etched deep in my heart.
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        His words, a weapon sharp and cruel,
        <br>
        <br>
        Like daggers piercing through my soul,
        <br>
        <br>
        He whispered torment, twisted lies,
        <br>
        <br>
        A master manipulator in disguise.

        His actions spoke of malintent,
        <br>
        <br>
        Leaving me haunted, broken and spent,
        <br>
        <br>
        In the depths of despair, I trembled and shook,
        <br>
        <br>
        Trapped in the web this evil man took.
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        But though his darkness may cast its shade,
        <br>
        <br>
        I refuse to let his power pervade,
        <br>
        <br>
        For in my strength, I find my might,
        <br>
        <br>
        To rise above, to reclaim my light.

        No longer defined by his malevolence,
        <br>
        <br>
        I break free, embracing resilience,
        <br>
        <br>
        His grasp may linger, but I'll heal,
        <br>
        <br>
        Transforming scars into strength and zeal.
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        In the face of evil, I'll stand tall,
        <br>
        <br>
        Defying the shadows that once enthralled,
        <br>
        <br>
        For I am more than a victim's plight,
        <br>
        <br>
        A survivor, a beacon of hope and light.

        Though scars may mark my journey's chart,

        I'll rewrite the story, healing my heart,
        <br>

        And in my triumph, I'll find release,

        A survivor, embracing courage's light,

        The evil man's power will fade away,
