                I got a vacation from school.
               <br>
               My routine has been seriously disrupted.
               <br>
               I came so close to committing suicide xD
               <br>
               I'm still dying from laughter over that, but whatever.
               <br>

               My friend texted me about inviting me out.
               <br>
               I refused because those who I despise were also coming, so yeah.
               <br>
               I'd rather kill myself than meet any of them.

               Dear visitors I hope you enjoy browsing my website.
               <br>
               I did make a commitment to update this site every day, but you can see, eh?
               <br>
               I'm going to start writing a blog now, and yeah that's all.
