        Hello people 
        <br>
        so where have I been?
        <br>
        Well my classes started
        <br>
        My first Deadline was last week
        <br>
        which was about Schizophrenia.
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        I have downloaded Kali Linux
        <br>
        because I will be taking "Cyber-Security" in uni, 
        <br>
        they finally confirmed the subject
        <br>
        or I would be taking "Creativy Computing."
        <br>
        <br>
        ... 
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm gonna drink water now and
        <br>
        then I'm gonna start writing blog 
        <br>
        That's all and I'm currently listening to 
        <br>
        NARCISSIST PERSONALITY DISORDER - Odetari
        <br>
        It's a vibe lmao
        <br>
