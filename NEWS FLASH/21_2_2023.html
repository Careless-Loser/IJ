                    Yay! I passed my math exam!
                    <br>
                    I resumed my reading.
                    <br>
                    I'm reading Austin Kleon's "Steal Like An Artist" right now.
                    <br>

                    Soon, I'll update my "Gallery View,"
                    <br>
                    " as well as my blog and poem.
                    <br>
                    I sincerely apologise for the absence of postings to "Art";
                    <br>
                    I have been trying to read instead of painting.

                    I miss my friends and wish I could see them, but I can't.
                    <br>
                    They are from my old school and have exams as well (sad life)
                    <br>
                    I went to a restaurant with a girl from my new school to celebrate the birthday of my sibling.
                    <br>

                    Sports day is approaching. I'll have to travel to another city for it, yee!
                    <br>
                    I really want to see this classical show, and the tickets are reasonably priced.
                    <br>
                    But I'm already going to sports day, and I spent a lot of money on a new phone.
                    <br>
                    I'm going to save it now in case I go eventually; we'll see.
