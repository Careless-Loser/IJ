                    I apologize for my absence, 
                    <br>
                    as life has kept me busy. 
                    <br>
                    However, I now have a little 
                    <br>
                    time to provide an update. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So, my holidays have finally begun,
                    <br>
                    and I've traveled back to my home 
                    <br>
                    country with high hopes of enjoying and relaxing. 
                    <br>
                    But oh boy, relaxation seems to be a distant dream here. 
                    <br>
                    And guess what? 
                    <br>
                    My driving skills are absolutely flawless 
                    <br>
                    no accidents or casualties, 
                    <br>
                    just pure driving perfection. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Oh, and by the way, 
                    <br>
                    I'm totally fine, 
                    <br>
                    except for this tiny illness that 
                    <br>
                    I'm keeping a secret because 
                    <br>
                    I'm just too perfect to let anyone worry about me. 
                    <br>
                    Blah blah, you know how it is.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Oh my goodness, guess what, folks? 
                    <br>
                    I finally received the result for my computer essay, 
                    <br>
                    which had to be sent all the way to 
                    <br>
                    the UK Board for a thorough check. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Can you believe it? 
                    <br>
                    I dedicated a whopping three months of my life to that masterpiece, 
                    <br>
                    but hey, it was totally worth it. 
                    <br>
                    Drumroll, please... I scored 84 out of 100! 
                    <br>
                    Can you comprehend the magnitude of this achievement? 
                    <br>
                    Getting marks in the 80s and 90s is like finding 
                    <br>
                    a needle in a haystack there, 
                    <br>
                    with a measly 0.9% chance of success. 
                    <br>
                    But of course, my hard work and 
                    <br>
                    unparalleled brilliance paid off once again. 
                    <br>
                    Now, I must bid you adieu and log off, 
                    <br>
                    because I have a blog and a poem to write, you know? 
                    <br>
                    And don't forget, I'm here to relax, 
                    <br>
                    so I'll be heading out for some leisurely activities. 
                    <br>
                    Ta-ta!
                    <br>
