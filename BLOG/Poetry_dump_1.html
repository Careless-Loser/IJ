                    <br>
                    I see red. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sometimes
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I close my eyes
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I see the blade
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Embedded into my stomach 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The acid fills my body cavity 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Im melting inside out
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The red. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It‚Äôs so pretty. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Dark and heavy
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It smears and streaks
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Pooling in the cracks of the tile
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My legs fail
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My head slams, audible splintering
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Alive, suffering, dying
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Complete euphoria 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As I drown 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the red.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I HAVE NEVER FELT LIKE THIS. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    NOT TOWARDS SOMEONE LIKE YOU. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    NOTHING BEYOND THE COMFORTABILITY OF YOUR YOUTH.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    THE LOVE IS THERE, IT SEEPS INTO EVERYTHING.
