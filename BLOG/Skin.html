            <p>
                I wish I wasn't who I am. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I wish I could shed my skin and transform into someone else, 
                <br>
                <br>
                leaving all of my problems and issues on that scaly, dry, old skin. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The skin never peels off or flakes off, but it clings to me. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Under this old, dry, and dirty skin, the skin 
                <br>
                <br>
                that is so healthy and almost glowing is lost. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My emotions erupt like blisters that are desperately 
                <br>
                <br>
                attempting to pull the skin away, 
                <br>
                <br>
                but it just grows back over. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Treatments and essential oils frighten me. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Imagine if I burn. 
                <br>
                <br>
                What if the top layers of my skin rip off, 
                <br>
                <br>
                exposing my flawless underlayers, 
                <br>
                <br>
                which would then bleed endlessly? 
                <br>
                <br>
                What if this flawless hidden skin stings 
                <br>
                <br>
                and recoils when exposed to the air,
                <br>
                <br>
                forcing it to be covered up with bandages? 
                <br>
                <br>
                What if there is no way to remove my skin and 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am destined to have this old, dry, dirty skin forever?
