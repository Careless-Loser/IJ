                    <br>
                    Darting pupils;

                    <br>
                    And that laugh. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Physically, so damn pretty.

                    <br>
                    Beautiful.

                    <br>
                    Silence. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It‚Äôs all I crave. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Motionless, ceiling fan above. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Quiet hum of the heater next to me. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Carpet underneath me. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Alone, happily.
