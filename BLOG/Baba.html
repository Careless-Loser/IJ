                    My endlessly hardworking baba,
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You provided your family
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The life you imagined as a child
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I want you to rest.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You seem drained.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I've never seen you cry before.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Nothing but smiles, giggles, and laughter
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You are constantly working.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And the photographs are missing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I love you and value everything you do.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And I hardly show it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am frequently stubborn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thank you for providing me with a home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A bed, clothes, and a phone
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thank you very much for the dinner.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And the hugs when I'm feeling down.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thank you for making the shoes I wear.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I swear you're the greatest.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But, for the most part,
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thank you very much for marrying my mother.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The lady who loves you
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And adores us
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Exactly as much as my father.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </center>
