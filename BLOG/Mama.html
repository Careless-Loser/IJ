                    My caring, impressive, and lovely Mama
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Your heart is so pure, loving and calm
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You stayed up all night
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Just to make sure everything was okay with us
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I swear to love you until I'm gone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I love you and am grateful for everything you do.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But I hardly display it, and I usually have an unpleasant attitude.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm grateful that you brought me into this world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For you to be my mother, Do you think I deserve it?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have disappointed you frequently...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You always forgave my mistakes, no matter what.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm grateful to you for teaching me how to walk and talk.
                    <br>
