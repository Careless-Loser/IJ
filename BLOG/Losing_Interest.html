                    It's a bit scary to start losing interest in the world around you. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Like, where tf did it go? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The drive you had for improving literally 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Just evaporated from your body and got replaced with apathy. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I guess you just failed one too many times and now your brain is 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    doing that trauma response thing. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Against your will. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    smh
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You only care about like.. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A handful of people now. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You used to wanna make friends in real life and talk to your classmates more but now you just... dont. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You do but then it is just all fake acting you removed them all from your contacts and social media.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    (They are not gonna help you in future then 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    why should you be friends with them in a first place huh?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm right aren't I? Like what even is the point? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They are gonna move to other country and would not wanna even meet you again.)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And it's hard to fake it too...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You don't want to be this way... 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You wanna keep trying, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You cant just be alone. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even though its not so bad...but it is bad. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ugh
