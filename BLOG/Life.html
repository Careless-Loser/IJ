                    "You ruin your life by tolerating it. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At the end of the day you should be excited to be alive. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When you settle for anything less than what you innately desire, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    you destroy the possibility that lives inside of you, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    and in that way you cheat both yourself and the world of your potential. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The next Michelangelo could be sitting behind a laptop right now writing an invoice for paperclips, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    because it pays the bills, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    or because it is comfortable, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    or because he can tolerate it. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Do not let this happen to you. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Do not ruin your life this way. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Life and work, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    and life and love, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    are not irrespective of each other. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They are intrinsically linked. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We have to strive to do extraordinary work, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    we have to strive to find extraordinary love. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Only then will we tap into an extraordinarily blissful life."
