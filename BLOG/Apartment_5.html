                    Apartment 5 is where I'm meant to be,
                    <br>
                    A place filled with love and positivity.
                    <br>
                    It's where I thrive and find my inspiration,
                    <br>
                    And always feel a sense of liberation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ... 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5 is more than just four walls,
                    <br>
                    It's a space where happiness always calls.
                    <br>
                    With plenty of natural light and a view,
                    <br>
                    It's a place that always feels brand new.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ... 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though there may be little quirks to fix,
                    <br>
                    I love it all, every little mix.
                    <br>
                    And even when things may seem tough,
                    <br>
                    I know that here, I am enough.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ... 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5 is where my heart truly lies,
                    <br>
                    And I'm grateful for each day it brings surprise.
                    <br>
                    With neighbors who have become dear friends,
                    <br>
                    I know that here, my joy never ends.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So here's to Apartment 5,
                    <br>
                    My haven where I can truly be me.
                    <br>
                    I'm grateful for all that it brings,
                    <br>
                    And for the love that in my heart sings.
