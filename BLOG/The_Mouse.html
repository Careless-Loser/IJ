                    For most of my life, I've lived in hiding. 
                    <br>
                    I was the clown of class, 
                    <br>
                    the one who didn't stand out or get perfect grades. 
                    <br>
                    But I knew something that my classmates didn't. 
                    <br>
                    I knew the reality of the world, 
                    <br>
                    how tough it can be. 
                    <br>
                    So, I acted like an idiot, 
                    <br>
                    so they wouldn't know that I knew more of what the reality is. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In grade 11, my English teacher noticed that 
                    <br>
                    (she saw me...I will never see her again.)
                    <br>
                    I had a better understanding than the average student, 
                    <br>
                    and she praised me a lot. 
                    <br>
                    It made my classmates angry. 
                    <br>
                    When the board exam results came out, 
                    <br>
                    I intentionally failed one subject, 
                    <br>
                    and I pretended to cry, 
                    <br>
                    saying that my dad would send me back to home country. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In reality, I was actually transferring to a better school. 
                    <br>
                    They all believed it. 
                    <br>
                    Now they know that I know more than them, 
                    <br>
                    and they want to be friends, 
                    <br>
                    but I prefer to keep my distance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But after this mask I created to face people, 
                    <br>
                    my sibling's best friend noticed something was off. 
                    <br>
                    (she saw me...I will never see her again.)
                    <br>
                    They suggested that I see a doctor. 
                    <br>
                    So, I put on my mask again and acted shy, 
                    <br>
                    pretending like nothing happened. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Deep down, I know there's something wrong with me, 
                    <br>
                    maybe a personality disorder or something. 
                    <br>
                    Even my psychology teacher was scared from me, 
                    <br>
                    (she saw me...I will never see her again.)
                    <br>
                    but I reassured her that everything was fine. 
                    <br>
                    I convinced her that I'm perfect, 
                    <br>
                    pointing to my assignments as proof. 
                    <br>
                    She believed me, like a fool. 
                    <br>
                    I guess that's how it goes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are many anxieties swirling around in my mind. 
                    <br>
                    I see them as dark substances, 
                    <br>
                    slowly spreading through the roots of my thoughts, 
                    <br>
                    poisoning the once hopeful girl inside.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All I know is that my mind is always racing. 
                    <br>
                    It never stops. 
                    <br>
                    Sometimes it feels like my mind is working against me, 
                    <br>
                    like a weapon. 
                    <br>
                    It's the very thing that keeps me alive and well,
                    <br>
                    but it also brings many challenges to my life. 
                    <br>
                    One of those challenges is my natural tendency 
                    <br>
                    to stay hidden in the shadows, 
                    <br>
                    to be the one who quietly listens as others 
                    <br>
                    speak freely and enjoy the laughter. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It's that sinking feeling in my stomach, the realization that while others smile and shine, I simply stand there, feeling invisible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    (Guys I'm joking don't worry lol)
