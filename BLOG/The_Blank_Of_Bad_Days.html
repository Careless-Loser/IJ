                    When you are very depressed or anxious
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    unable to leave the house, or the sofa, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    or to think of anything but the depression. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It can be unbearably hard. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Bad days come in degrees. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They are not all equally bad. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And the really bad ones, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    though horrible to live through, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    are useful for later. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You store them up. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A bank of bad days. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The day you had:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1. To run out of the supermarket. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2. The day you were so depressed your tongue wouldn't move. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. The day you made your parents cry. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4. The day you nearly threw yourself off.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You are having another bad day you can say, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Well, this feels bad, but
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    there have been worse. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And even cliff. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So if when you can think of no worse day when 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    the one you are living is the very worst there 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    has ever been least know the bank exists and that 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    you have made a deposit. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You at least know the bank exists 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    and that you have made deposit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
