                    Sometimes there are people who are not meant to
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    be in your life any longer than they already are. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That's a bittersweet thing, especially when you realise
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    that their time to leave is over and beyond your control. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I think it makes sense. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If everything was permanent, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    then the meaning would not be so clear. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I think a lot about my future friends, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    the people I have not met yet for x and x reasons, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    but I will meet them and they fascinate me. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Getting older is a very scary thing for me.
                    <br>

                    Tonight a comet passes by the earth. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ... 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Apparently it's the first time it's passed by in 50,000 years. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And after that it might have to wait another 50,000 years to pass by again. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I really wanted to try and see it, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    but it's raining here. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But the comet still fascinates me. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It must be so lonely to wait 50,000 years.
