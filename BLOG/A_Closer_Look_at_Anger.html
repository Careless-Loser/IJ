                    In the intricate tapestry of human emotions, happiness and sadness delicately sit within the recesses of our minds. 
                    <br>
                    They're the cherished children of our internal world, cradled by tears and smiles, held close to our hearts as favorites, 
                    <br>
                    the cared-for fragments of our emotional spectrum.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In stark contrast, anger is a formidable force that refuses to be confined to the depths of our consciousness. 
                    <br>
                    It's not a fleeting visitor like happiness or sadness; instead, 
                    <br>
                    it lingers in the palms of our hands, balled up like fists ready to shatter the fragile equilibrium of our existence. 
                    <br>
                    It breaks bones and glass, leaving behind a trail of destruction, a testament to the intensity with which it grips our very being.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Happy and sad emotions find expression in the subtleties of our faces, leaving an indelible mark on our countenance. 
                    <br>
                    The dried tears and bright smiles become a spectacle for passersby, inviting stares and curious glances. 
                    <br>
                    They are frozen moments, snapshots of our emotional landscape, captured in the still image of memory.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Anger, on the other hand, refuses to be frozen. It is a constant, an ever-present companion that permeates every waking moment of our lives. 
                    <br>
                    It manifests as a glass plate thrown against a wall, as obscenities screamed at a mirror, 
                    <br>
                    as the violent act of ripping hair from our heads in a futile attempt to rid ourselves of the pain that simmers within. 
                    <br>
                    The aftermath is bloodied hands and torn curtains, physical manifestations of the internal turmoil we're unwilling to share with the world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the realm of emotions, anger is the ugly that we often keep hidden, a darkness that we're afraid to expose to the light. 
                    <br>
                    It's an internal struggle, a battle between the desire to release the pent-up rage and the fear of facing the consequences of that release. 
                    <br>
                    The more we try to suppress it, the more it festers, consuming our faces and chests, screaming to be acknowledged.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The dichotomy between the ephemeral beauty of happiness and the enduring ugliness of anger is a constant tension within ourselves. 
                    <br>
                    While the former is a fleeting visitor, a cherished moment frozen in time, the latter is an ever-present force that demands acknowledgment. 
                    <br>
                    It's a struggle that defines our emotional landscape, a journey toward understanding and acceptance of the complexities that reside within us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we navigate the labyrinth of our emotions, it becomes imperative to recognize that anger, too, is a part of the human experience. 
                    <br>
                    It's not a flaw but a facet of our intricate selves. By acknowledging and addressing the darkness within, 
                    <br>
                    we can begin the transformative process of finding balance and embracing the full spectrum of our emotions. 
                    <br>
                    In doing so, we unravel the tapestry, revealing the nuanced interplay between happiness, sadness, and the often misunderstood emotion that is anger.
